            <p class ="p1">Lesson 1 <br> </p>
            <p class ="p2"> The Composition of the Earth's Interior</p>
               <p class ="p3">The Earth's composition tells a story about itself. It gives us clues to its  past    and proofs about the gradual and slow 
                changes that it has undergone for over 4.6 billion years.</p>
                <p class ="p4">The crust is the thinnest and the outermost layer of the Earth that extends from the surface to about 32 kilometers below. Underneath some mountains, the crust's thickness extendeds to 72 kilometers. The Earth's crust, as gleaned from the figure below, is subdivided into two regions: the continental crust and the oceanic crust.
                <br><br>
                Beneath the crust is the mantle, which extends to about 2900 kilometers from the Earth's surface. It makes up about
                80% of the Earth's total volume and about 68% of its total mass. The mantle is mainly made up of silicate rocks, and
                contrary to common belief, is solid, since both S-waves and P-waves pass through it. The attempt to study the
                Earth's mantle extended as far as studying the rocks from the volcanoes, simply because they were formed in the
                mantle.
                <br><br> Scientist also studied rocks from the ocean floor. They have determined that the mantle is mostly made of the
                elements silicon, oxygen, iron and magnesium. The lower part of the mantle consists of more iron than the upper part.
                This explains that the lower mantle is denser than the upper motion. The temperature and the pressure increase with
                depth. The high temperature and pressure in the mantle allows the solid rock to flow slowly.The crust and the
                uppermost part of the mantle form a relatively cool, outermost rigid shell called lithosphere and is about
                50 to 100 kilometers thick.
                <br><br> These lithosperic plates moves relatively to each other. Beneath the lithospere lies the soft,
                weak layer known as the asthenosphere, made of hot molten material. It's temperature is about 300 - 800°C.
                The upper 150 kilometers of the asthenosphere has a temperature enough to facilitate a small amount of melting, and
                make it capable to flow. This property of the asthenosphere facilitates the movement of the lithosperic plates.
                The lithosphere, with the continents on top of it, is being carried by the flowing asthenosphere.
                <br><br>
                The core is subdivided into two layers:
                <br>
                Outer Core - This outer core is 2900 kilometers below the Earth's surface. It is 2250 kilometers thick and is made up
                of iron and nickel. The temperature in the outer core reaches up to 2000°C at this very high temperature,
                iron and nickel melt. Aside from seismic data analysis, the Earth's magnetic field strengthens the idea that the
                Earth's outer core is molten/liquid. The outer core is mainly made up of iron and nickel moving around the
                solid inner core, creating Earth's magnetism.
                <br><br>
                Inner Core - the inner core is made up of solid iron and nickel and has a radius of 1300 kilometers. Its temperature reaches
                to about 5000°C. The extreme temperature could have molten the iron and nickel but it is believed to have solidified as a
                result of pressure freezing, which is common to liquids subjected under tremendous pressure.

            <p class ="p2">The Earth's Mechanism</p>
            <p class="p3">The Continental Drift</p>
            <p class="p4">In 1912, Alfred Wegener (pronounced as vey-guh-nuh-r) a German meteorologist, proposed a theory that about 200 million years ago , the continents were once one large landmass. He called this landmass "Pangaea", a Greek word which means "All Earth". the picture below shows how Pangaea evolved into how the continents look today. This Pangaea started to break into two smaller supercontinent called "Laurasia" and "Gondwanaland" during the Jurassic Period. These smaller supercontinents broke into the continents and these continents seperated and drifted apart since then. Is this idea somehow true? If you lived during Wegener's time, will you believe him?
                <br><br>
            Wegener searched for evidences to support his claim. He noticed the fit of the edges of the continents on the opposite sides of the South Atlantic. His evidences to the Continental Drift Theory includes the distribution of fossils in different continents, rock features, and ancient climates. <b>Let us have a further study on these evidences.</b></p>

            <p class="p3">The Continental Jigsaw Puzzle</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Did it really start as one big landmass? It seems very impossible that the seven continents, which are currently thousands of miles away from each other were actually connected pieces of a supercontinent.
                <br><br>
                The most visible and fascinating evidence that these continents were once one is their shapes. The edge of one continent surprisingly matches the edge of another: South America and Africa fit together; India, Antarctica, and Australia match one another; Eurasia and North America complete the whole continental puzzle in the north.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">From Fossils</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms (plants and animals) from the remote past. Fossilized leaves of an extinct plant Glossopteris were found in 250 million years old rocks. These fossils were located in the continents of Southern Africa, Australia, India, and Antarctica, which are now separated from each other by wide oceans. The large seeds of this plant could not possibly travel a long journey by the wind or survive a rough ride through ocean waves.
                <br><br>
                Mesosaurus and Lystosaurus are freshwater reptiles. Fossils of these animals were discovered in different continents, such as in South America and Africa. It is impossible for these reptiles to swim over the vast oceans and move from one continent to another. Fossils were also found in Antarctica. Could it be possible that they existed in this region where temperature was very low? Or could it be possible that, long before, Antarctica was not in its current position?
            </p>
            <p class="p3">From Rocks</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Fossils found in rocks support the Continental Drift Theory. The rocks themselves also provide evidence that continents drifted apart from each other. For Example, Rock formations in Africa line up with that in South America as if it was a long mountain range. How come these rock layers in different continents line up together with layers that exactly matched? The folded cape mountains of South America and Africa line up perfectly as if they were once a long mountain range.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">From Coal Deposits</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Coal beds were formed from the compaction and decomposition of swamp plants that lived million years ago. These were discovered in South America, Africa, Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and even in Antarctica. How is a coal bed formation possible in Antarctica?
                The current location of Antarctica could not sustain substantial amount of life. If there is a substantial quantity of coal in it, thus, it only means that Antarctica must have been positioned in a part of the Earth where it once supported large quantities of life. This leads to the idea that Antarctica once experienced a tropical climate, thus, it might have been closer before to the equator.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">The Sea Floor Spreading</p>
            <p class="p4">
                The question as to how the drifting took place left the Continental Drift Theory blurry. Despite the evidences presented by Wegener, his idea that the continents were once joined together was not accepted by the scientific society until the 1960s. He wasn’t able to explain how this drifting took place. This made scientists conduct further studies in search for the answer.
                <br><br>
                During the 1950s and 1960s, new techniques and modern gadgets enabled scientists to make better observations and gather new information about the ocean floor. With the use of sonars and submersibles, scientists had a clearer view of the ocean floors. They have discovered underwater features deep within the ocean.
                Scientists found a system of ridges or mountains in the seafloor similar to those found in the continents. These are called mid-ocean ridges. One of these is the famous Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an undersea mountain chain in the Atlantic Ocean. It has a gigantic cleft about 32-48 km long and 1.6 km deep. The ridge is offset by fracture zones or rift valleys.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">Magnetic Reversal</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Seafloor spreading was strengthened with the discovery that the magnetic rocks near the ridge follow a pattern aside from the fact that rocks near the ridge are remarkably younger than those father from the ridge. A magnetic compass tells us directions on Earth. It also proves that the Earth has a magnetic field. The needle of a magnetic compass usually points to the North Pole of the Earth which is actually the South Magnetic Pole at present.
                <br><br>
                The Earth’s magnetic field is generated in the very hot molten outer core and has already existed since the birth of our planet. The Earth’s magnetic field is a dipole, one that has a North Pole and a South Pole.
                What is magnetic reversal? How does magnetic reversal happen and how does it prove seafloor spreading? Magnetic reversal is also called magnetic ‘flip’ of the Earth. It happens when the North Pole is transformed into a South Pole and the South Pole becomes the North Pole. This is due to the change in the direction of flow in the outer core.
                <br><br>
                Magnetic reversals happened many times in the past. The occurrence of magnetic reversals can be explained through the magnetic patterns in magnetic rocks, especially those found in the ocean floor. When lava solidifies, iron bearing minerals crystallize. As these crystallize, the minerals behave like tiny compasses and align with the Earth’s magnetic field. So when magnetic reversal occurs, there is also a change in the polarity of the rocks. This allowed scientists to visualize the magnetic stripes in the ocean floor , and to construct a magnetic polarity time scale.

            <p class ="p1">Lesson 3 <br> </p>
            <p class ="p2">Plate Tectonics</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Our country is blessed with so many land features such as mountains and volcanoes. These features can be sources of different minerals or can be used for agricultural purposes. For example, we have the majestic and world renowned Mayon Volcano. Because of its activity, it produces fertile slopes and plains which are used by the locals to grow their crops. Also, found in the northeastern coast of Luzon, we have the Sierra Madre mountain range which is home to many endemic species of flora and fauna.
                <br><br>
                Have you ever wondered why our country is endowed with these kind of geologic features? Well, if your answer is YES, then this module will help you find the answer to your question.
                <br><br>
                In this lesson, we will study thoroughly the framework that will enable us to understand how and why several features of the Earth continuously change. This theory is what we call <b>“Plate Tectonics.”</b>
                <br><br>
                This describes the events within the Earth that give rise to mountain ranges, volcanoes, earthquake belts, and other features of the Earth’s surface.
                <br><br>
                At the end of this lesson, you are expected to get the key points of the lesson.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p3">What is Plate Tectonics?</p>
            <p class="p4">
                The crust is made of a variety of solid rocks like sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. It has an average density of 2.8 g/cm3 and its thickness ranges from 5 to 50 km. The crust is thickest in a part where a relatively young mountain is present and thinnest along the ocean floor.
                You will notice from the image that there are two kinds of crust :the thicker but less dense continental crust and the oceanic crust which is relatively thinner but denser than continental crust.
                <br><br>
                According to the plate tectonics model, the entire lithosphere of the Earth is broken into numerous segments called plates.
                <br><br>
                As shown in Figure 2, there are seven relatively large plates and a number of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate. The plates move very slowly but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory of moving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics.
                <br><br>
                Before we study more about plate tectonics, let’s discuss first one of the consequences of moving crustal plates which is crucial in studying plate tectonics: earthquake.
                <br><br>
                You have learned in your Grade 8 Science that an earthquake releases three types of seismic waves; Primary (P-waves), Secondary (S-waves), and Long surface waves (L-waves). The first two travel into the Earth’s interior while the last one on the surface. These waves travel at different velocities; thus, do not arrive at a seismic recording station at the same time. The farther the recording instrument is from the focus, the greater the difference in arrival times of the first P-wave compared to the first S-wave. The difference in the arrival time will tell us the distance of the earthquake’s focus from the seismic recording station. However, it does not tell in which direction it came from.
                <br><br>
                If we have at least three recording stations that can tell how far away from them the earthquake occurred, the epicenter can be determined using the triangulation method. It uses distance information from three seismic stations to locate the earthquake epicenter. On a map, circles are drawn around each seismic station. The radii of the circles are scaled to the estimated distance from the station to the earthquake. The three circles will intersect at one point that locates the earthquake.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">Types of Plate Boundaries</p>
            <p class="p4">
                Studying plate boundaries is important because along these boundaries deformation of the lithosphere is happening. These geologic events have a great impact not only on the environment but also on us.
                <br><br>
                There are three distinct types of plate boundaries, which are differentiated by the type of movement they exhibit.
                <br><br>
                The first type of plate boundary is termed divergent boundary wherein plates move apart, creating a zone of tension. Can you identify adjacent plates depicting divergent boundary on Figure 8?
                <br><br>
                Let’s take the case of the Philippine plate and the Eurasian plate. You will notice that the two plates are moving toward each other. This is an example of a zone where plates collide, and this second type of plate boundary is called convergent plate boundary.
                <br><br>
                The third type is the transform fault boundary where plates slide or grind past each other without diverging or converging. The best example of this plate boundary is the San Andreas fault which is bounded by the North American plate and the Pacific plate.

                <p class="p2">Electricity and Magnetism</p>
                <p class="p4">
                    The moving iron core within the Earth acts like a giant bar magnet. It produces a weak geomagnetic field that surrounds and partially protects us from solar radiations. In like manner, the moving charges within the Sun generate an eruption of radiations. This produces a solar magnetic field that spreads throughout the solar system and beyond. Moreover, a solar wind of charged particles constantly interacts with the Earth’s changing geomagnetic field.
                    <br><br>
                    In Grade 8 Science, you learned some characteristics of heat, visible light, and electricity whereas in Grade 9 Science, you were introduced to the <b>forms and sources of energy</b>. You also learned how electrical energy is generated, transmitted, and distributed. Using the principles of forces, motion and energy, Unit 2 of Grade 10 Science which is intended for the second quarter, supports investigations on the electric, magnetic and electromagnetic phenomena all around us. Eventually, this unit will help you to understand the different electromagnetic waves commonly known as the EM spectrum with a final emphasis on the visible light.
                    <br><br>
                    In this lesson, you will map two invisible force fields - the electric and the magnetic fields. Within each field, forces may be exerted on matter causing it to interact with another matter because of electricity and magnetism working as two aspects of a single electromagnetic force.
                    <br><br>
                    You will further explore, demonstrate and explain the idea that a changing electric field produces magnetism, and a changing magnetic field produces electric current in the light of technological applications that are helpful to man.
                </p>
                <p class="p3">  Getting Hooked on Electricity And Magnetism Applications </p>
                <p class="p5">AVPs: Veni, vidi, vici. (Audio-Visual Productions: I came, I saw, I conquered.)</p>
                <p class="p4">
                    People readily adopt emerging technologies. The use of audiovisual (AV) works be it in film productions, in business displays, or perhaps in education innovations became a trend and it is here to stay. Examples abound like our growing love for the high quality audiovisual components we listen to and watch or the endeavor of school stakeholders to provide projection technology in every classroom.
                    <br><br>
                    A typical broadcast studio consists of an audio console, microphones, computers, studio monitors, and disc players. The audio console converts analog audio (voice via microphone) and phone calls to a digital output. It also allows for the mixing of all sound sources from CDs, computers, and other digital sources before being sent to the transmitter. A slider controls the volume of each sound source. The live audio and control rooms are connected by cables for the exchange of audio and digital data signal during recording, mixing, and even editing of all audio-video elements digitally stored on hard drives
                    <br><br>
                    Many of the recording technology are founded entirely or partially on the relationship between electricity and magnetism known as electromagnetic induction.
                    Devices that detect and convert audio inputs to electric outputs or vice versa are called transducers. Most transducers like microphones and speakers use the “generator effect” characterized by the production of forces due to a changing electric signal within a magnetic field or a changing field near a current-carrying conductor.
                    <br><br>
                    Magnets exert either a force of repulsion or attraction. If a force of attraction only is possible between an object and a magnet, then the object interacting with the magnet contains a ferromagnetic substance and is considered naturally magnetic. If a force of repulsion is also possible between an object and a magnet, then the object interacting with the magnet may also be a permanent magnet or a temporarily magnetized ferromagnetic material.

                    <b>A Look Back in History:</b>
                    In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted (ˈƏr-stəd), a professor in the University of Copenhagen, discovered during a class demonstration that a current carrying wire caused a nearby magnetized compass needle to deflect. This observation fired up tremendous research on electromagnetism. As a result, the effect on the motion of conductors placed within a magnetic field (such as in the operation of electric motors) was also experimented much and paved the way for practical electricity.
                    <br><br>
                    Twelve years after this discovery, Michael Faraday (ˈFer-ə-dā) conducted his famous induction ring experiment showing that current can be produced by sources of changing magnetic fields. This is the key principle to practical generation of electricity.

                    <b>Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field</b> <br>
                    A non-magnetic current-carrying wire within a strong magnetic field, like copper for instance, will experience a magnetic force as indicated by the wire’s movement relative to the magnetic field. This turning effect on a coil is used in ammeters and motors that use permanent magnets and electromagnets.

                    <b>Speed Control Technology </b>– To ensure road safety and minimize vehicular-related death, buses, and other public utility vehicles can be equipped with a speed control device that limits the maximum speed by using electro magnetic brakes in combination with a motor once the limit is exceeded.
                    <br><br>
                    Speed control motor packages include the motor, the driver (controller), and a potentiometer which allows the driver for easy speed control adjustment. When the speed of this motor is controlled, a tacho-generator connected to the motor detects the speed. It is a magnet connected directly to the motor shaft and stator coil. The stator coil detects the magnetic field and generates an alternating current (AC) voltage.
                    <br><br>
                    Since this voltage and frequency increase with a rise of the rotational speed, the rotational speed of the motor is controlled based on this signal.
                    <br><br>
                  <b>  Traffic Light</b> – Vehicles waiting at intersections with coils buried underneath is within an electromagnetic field. Changes in the field activate the traffic light as programmed.
                  <br><br>
                    Typical red-light traffic systems have two induction-loop triggers made of rectangular or concentric wire loops buried under the road close to the stop line. This wire is connected to an electrical power source and a meter.
                    <br><br>
                    The current through the wire produces a magnetic field affecting objects around the loop and the loop itself. When there is another conductive material within the magnetic field, then a changing induced voltage is detected. This results to changing magnetic flux that triggers the traffic system according to its programmed mechanism.
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Metal Detector</b> – Metal detectors trigger the “Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!” sound when objects with parts that are magnetic in nature move past it. This signal a precious find, a hidden unwanted object or a need for further security check.
                   <br><br>
                    The transmitter coil is given a pulsed current long enough for the transmitter’s magnetic field to reach the metal target. The transmitter’s loop current is then turned off. The changing or collapsing magnetic field induces an electromotive force that induce charges to flow in the metal target. This induced current creates a reradiated magnetic field that can be detected by a receiver coil located at the sensor.
                    <br><br>
                    In some metal detectors, it is the device that is moved over the object. In other detectors, it is the object or the person that moves pass the machine. Whatever is the case, the current-carrying transmitting coil creates a changing magnetic field which in turn creates a changing electric field that creates the secondary magnetic field detected by the receiver coil.
                    <br><br>
                  <b>  Induction Stove</b> – Food cooks faster when heat is conducted directly and almost entirely at the base of the cooking pot. In induction stoves, current flowing through the copper coil wound underneath the cooking surface produces an electromagnetic field small enough to surround the base of the cooking pot. The magnetic field induces an electric current within the base of the metal pot. The metal in the cookware has electrical resistance that opposes the induced current and causes friction for the pot to heat up.
                  <br><br>
                    Heat transfer in an induction stove is more efficient than that via the gas stove because almost all of its heat is conducted directly to the base of the pot unlike in gas stoves where much heat escapes around the side and heats up the room and the rest of the cooking pot.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Magnetic Recording</b> – Computer working memories (RAM’s and ROM’s), mass storage memories (magnetic hard disks, floppy disks, magnetic tape drives, and optical disk drives), and practically all write-able card storage devices (magnetic cards, smart cards, and flash memory cards) make use of the magneto-optical characteristic of the recording media to store information.

                <p class="p4">
                    In Lesson 1, you have learned about the interrelationship between electricity and magnetism. You were able to discover how electric field could create magnetic field and vice versa. In this lesson, you will learn about the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This module will lead you to understand how electromagnetic waves transport energy. It also consists of activities that will enrich your understanding on the application of electromagnetic waves in our everyday living, and consequently, how these waves affect living things and the environment.

                <p class="p3">The Electric and Magnetic Fields Together</p>
                <p class="p4">
                    Accelerating electrons produce electromagnetic waves. These waves are a combination of electric and magnetic fields. A changing magnetic field produces an electric field and a changing electric field produces a magnetic field. As accelerated electrons produce an electric field of a wave, the varying electric field produces the wave’s magnetic field. Both the electric field and the magnetic field oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of the propagating wave. All electromagnetic waves can travel through a medium but unlike other types of waves, they can also travel in vacuum. They travel in vacuum at a speed of 3X108 m/s and denoted as c, the speed of light. The wave speed, frequency, and wavelength are related by the following equation:
                    <b>v=λf</b> <br>
                    where v is the wave speed, or c (speed of light) expressed in meters per second, the frequency f is expressed in Hertz and the wavelength λ is expressed in meters.
                        <br><br>
                    Since all the EM waves have the same speed and that is equal to the speed of light, as wavelength decreases, the frequency of the wave increases.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the years, the advancement on the knowledge about electromagnetic waves led us to a modern technological world.

                The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum of electromagnetic waves arranged according to frequency and wavelength. It is a gradual progression from the waves of lowest frequencies to the waves of highest frequencies. According to increasing frequency, the EM spectrum includes: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These waves do not have exact dividing region.
                <br><br>
                The different types of electromagnetic waves are defined by the amount of energy carried by/possessed by the photons. Photons are bundles of wave energy. The energy of a photon is given by the equation: <b> E=hf</b> <br>
                where h is the Planck’s Constant and f is the frequency of the EM wave. The value of the Planck’s constant is 6.63 x 10-34 joules per second.
                <br><br>
                From among the EM waves, the gamma rays have photons of high energies while radio waves have photons with the lowest energies.
                <br><br>
                With regards to wavelength, radio waves can be likened to the size of a football field while gamma rays are as small as the nuclei of an atom.

                <p class="p2">Coordinated Functions of the Nervous System</p>
                <p class="p4">The human body is made up of different systems that corrdinate with one another in order to perform their functions as well. If any part of these organ systems malfunctions, the body will become unbalanced.
                    The instability caused by the malfunctioning of one system cannot be made stable by other systems because each systems has its own function in the body.
                    You have studied in the past that human body systems are the combined functional units composed of various organs that work in full coordination with one other.
                    In Grade 9, you have already studied how the circulatory and respiratory systems work together and how lifestyle affects these systems. Now you will learn about the coordinated functions of the reproductive,endocrine, and nervous system. 
                    As you go through this lesson, you will be able to understand organisms having feedback mechanisms, are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems. 
                    You will also learn how these feedback mechanisms help organisms maintain homeostasis to reproduce and survive.

                <br><br>
                <p class="p5">Central Nervous System(CNS)</p>
               <p class="p4">The CNS serves as the main processing center for the entire nervous system. <br>It consists of two main components, namely the:</p>
               <ol class="list">
               <li><b> Brain</b> -
                This is an organ  located within the skull that functions as organizer and distributor of information for the body. <br><br> It has three main parts:</li>

                    <ol class="list2">
                        <li>Cerebrum - large, upper part of the brain that controls activity and thought.</li>
                        <li>Cerebellum - the part under the cerebrum that controls posture, balance, and coordination.</li>
                        <li>Brain Stem - the part that connects the brain to the spinal cord and controls automatic functions such as breathing, digestion, heart rate, and blood pressure.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li><b>Spinal Cord -</b> 
                        This serves as a channel for signals between the brain and the rest of the body, and controls simple musculoskeletal reflexes without input from the brain.</li>
                      <br><br>
                    <p class="p5">Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</p>
                        <p class="p4"> The PNS connects the central nervous system to the organs and limbs.It has two main divisions:</p>

                            <li><b>Somatic Nervous System -</b>
                                This system is associated with the voluntary control of body movements and has two main parts:</li>
                                    <ol class="list3">
                                        <li> Spinal Nerves  - the nerves that carry motor and sensory signals between the spinal cord and the body.</li>
                                        <li>Cranial Nerves - the nerve fibers that carry information into and out of the brain stem.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                 <li><b> Autonomic Nervous System -</b> This system is associated with the involuntary control of body movements and has two subdivisions:  </li>
                                 <ol class="list3">
                                    <li>Sympathetic - it is activated when the body is in a dynamic role or stress (e.g., increased heart rate and breathing, dilation of pupil, sweating, etc.) </li>
                                    <li>Parasympathetic - it maintains body functions and restores the body to normal or relaxed mode. </li>

               <p class="p3">  The Nerve Cell</p>
               <p class="p4">The basic unit of the nervous system is the nerve cell. Nerve cells are called neurons. Study the image and look at the different parts of the neuron.
                <br><br>There are billions of neuron in the body. Some exist alone. Others are joined together to form organs like the brain and spinal cord.
               There are twelve to fourteen billions of neurons in one part of the brain alone. 
               A neuron has a cell body containing the nucleus. Projecting out from the cell body are root-like structures. These are dendrites and axons. Dendrites carry impulses towards the cell body. A cell may have as many as 200 dendrites carrying impulses toward the cell body. 
               <br><br>
               A single dendrite can be over one meter long. Axons carry impulses away from the cell body. Axons pass impulses to the dendrites of other neurons or cell body of muscle cells. Axons can be grouped together into cable-like bundles called nerves.</p>
               <p class="p5">The Basic Parts of Neuron <br><br>  The Nerve Impulse</p>
               <p class="p4">Neurons are cells with the special ability to carry signals or impulses.
                Thoughts, emotions, learning, and many body functions are carried by nerve impulses in the neurons. A nerve impulse is a combination of an electrical charge and a chemical reaction. A nerve impulse is not a flow of electricity, but an electrochemical signal moving along neuron. 
                Imagine that you have a board with a row of switches. Quickly click each switch in the row on and off. This will give you an idea of how a nerve impulse travels along a neuron. 
                <br><br>
                A nerve impulse cannot jump from one neuron to another. When a nerve impulse cannot jump from one neuron to another. When a nerve impulse comes to the end of an axon, it produces the chemical, called neurotransmitter, to be released . The chemical crosses the space between neurons called synapse and stimulates the berve impulse to start in the dendrite.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">The nervous system is assisted by five sense organs- the eyes, ears, nose, tounge, and skin. 
                These sense organs are constanly receiving information from the environment and sending messages to the brain. These sense organs are constantly receiving information from the environment  and sending messages to the brain. These senses aid in the survival of human beings. 
                A stimulus (plural:stimuli) is any factor in the environment that may trigger a nerve impulse. A response is a reaction to a stimulus. A stimulus is received by the body and a response  is made. An organism must be able to respond to a stimulus in order to survive. Messages do not travel in both directions along the same neuron. Only the axon of the neuron releases neurotransmitters that cross the space between neurons. 
                Reaction time is the length of time between application of a stimulus and detection of a response.</p>

            <p class="p5">  The Function of Endocrine System</p>
            <p class="p4"> The endocrine sytem composed of glands that secrete different types of hormones that affect almost every cell, organ, and function of our body. It is essential in regulating growth and development, metabolism, as well as reproductive processes and mood.
                How does your endocrine system function?
                Endocrine glands secrete chemicals knows as hormones into the bloodstream, which carries them throughout the body. When a hormone in the blood reaches the target organ , it produces a notable effect. The endocrine system sends signals all over the body, much like the nervous system, but unlike the instant responses activated by the nervous system, the effects can take a few hours or even weeks.</p>
                <p class="p5">Endocrine Glands and Their Hormones</p>
                <p class="p4"> The endocrine system contains a group of glands that release hormones into the body. The following table lists all the major glands in the body, with their  functions, locations, and the hormones they release.</p>

                <p class="p3">Effects of Hormones in the Body</p>
                <p class="p4"> Several processes in the body are coordinated by hormones which regulates and balance the working
                    of organs, tissues, and cells. The endocrine system influences how your heart beats
                    ,how your bones and tissues develop, and even your capacity to have a baby. It plays
                    an essential role in the occurence of disorders such as diabetes, thyroid disease
                    ,growth disorders, and/or sexual dysfunction. 
                    <br><br>
                    Both men and women produce hormones in the same areas with one exception, the reproductive glands.
                    Additional male hormones are produced in the testes while female hormones are produced in the ovaries.
                    <br><br>
                    Some hormones have short-term effects while other hormones have long-term effects such as those
                    that control our growth and the changes at the onset of puberty. During puberty, there are many 
                    hormonal changes that happen in your body. One moment you laugh, and then suddenly 
                    you feel like crying. Sudden mood swings are relatively caused by the increasing
                    amount of hormones in the body at this stage. It is therefore important to maintain
                    a positive outlook in life and remember that these changes are only temporary and
                    will stabilize with time.
                    <br><br>
                    Hormones act in very small amounts. If the organ and hormones do not produce the 
                    regulated amount of chemicals to your body, it may result in
                    an abnormality of your body. This condition is called <b> hormonal imbalance </b>.
                    An increase or decrease in its amount may have a significant effect in the human body.</p>

                    <p class="p3">The Reproductive System</p>
                    <p class="p4">For most living creatures, reproduction is basically a normal process controlled by hormones, the process is rather more complicated. Unlike the other organism such as plants and animals, you can make decisions about reproduction. However, like any other living things, human depend on reproduction for the survival of the species. If people stop to reproduce, the human species would become extinct.
                        <br><br>
                        The system involved in sexual reproduction is called the reproductive system. There is a striking difference between the male and the female reproductive systems, although they also share a number of similarities. For example, the reproductive organs of the male and female are developed from the same embroyological structures, and some hormones are commonly found in both male and female, in varying quantities and produce different responses.</p>
                    <p class="p3">The Male Reproductive System</p>
                    <p class="p4">Examine the diagram of the male reproductive system. The picture shows the main parts of the male reproductive system. The cross-sectional side view if the reproductive system shows that certain parts of the male reproductive system are also part of the excretory system. <br> Be familiar with the specific functions of each basic part using the table below:</p>

                <p class="p2">Behavior of Gases</p>
                <p class="p4"><b>Introduction </b> <br>
                    This module offers interesting discussion about gases. You will have a chance to get to know important concepts that will make you appreciate the properties and the behavior of gases.
                    <br><br>
                    Most gases are invisible. We can name as many solids and liquids that we see around us but not gases. It is only the very few colored ones like the black smoke produced by smoke belchers that can be seen. Unseen gases are present, to name a few, in a bottle that seems to be empty, in the production of food by the plant, and even in playing our favorite sports. Can you play your favorite sports like volleyball and basketball without the ball sufficiently filled with air or gas? Even our very own existence requires the presence of unseen gases. We take in oxygen and we exhale carbon dioxide. Can we survive here on earth without the desirable gases which support life?
                    <br><br>
                    You have just observed that gases have volume, mass, temperature, and exert pressure. From your daily experiences, can you enumerate some instances where these properties are shown?
                    <br><br>
                    The warm temperature we are experiencing is from the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor to name a few).
                    <br><br>
                    The basketball is filled with air. So, it bounces while you are dribbling it. The same is true with the other kinds of ball.
                    <br><br>
                    When you open a can or bottle of softdrinks, it fizzes because of the escaping dissolved carbon dioxide due to change of pressure. When the wind blows, it exerts pressure too. There are a lot of manifestations of gases though we cannot see them.
                    <br><br>
                    Now that we have proven that gases have mass, volume, temperature, and pressure, let us now be familiar with the units being used to express these properties of gases. Can you identify whether a unit represents volume or pressure or temperature? Below is the list of these units. Start familiarizing yourself with them.

                     <p class="p5">Robert Boyle (1627-1691)</p>
                     <p class="p4">The relationship between the volume and pressure of gases at constant temperature was first stated by Robert Boyle during the 16th century. He performed an experiment wherein he trapped a fixed amount of air in the J-tube, he changed the pressure and controlled the temperature and then, he observed its effect to the volume of the air inside the J-tube. He found out that as the pressure is increased, the volume decreases. He finally concluded that the volume of a fixed amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at constant temperature.
                        <br><br>
                        Gas particles have a very weak intermolecular force of attraction, hence they move as far as possible from each other. They have the tendency to occupy all the spaces they are contained in. If the pressure is increased, the volume will be decreased forcing the gas particles to move closer to one another.
                        The observations in Activity 2 can be expressed in the Boyle’s Law equation:

                     </div>
                     <p class="p4">Where: V = volume, P = pressure, T = temperature and n = amount of the gas.
                        <br><br>
                        How will you read the above sited equation? It is read as: The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure, if temperature and amount of a gas are held constant.
                        <br><br>
                        It can also be read as: At constant temperature, the volume occupied by a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to the reciprocal of pressure (1/P).

                <p class="p2">Chemical Reaction</p>
                <p class="p4"><b>Introduction</b> <br>
                    From the time we get up in the morning to the time that we sleep at night, chemical changes are taking place, within us and outside of us. Plants grow through photosynthesis, foods that we eat are digested by the body, metals corrode, raw materials are being converted to useful products, new medicines are being developed, more versatile and cost effective materials are being made.
                    <br><br>
                    Various chemical changes that occur around us have significant effects to our environment and consequently to our health. Chemical changes occurring in industries result to products that are useful to us. The wastes we throw continue to undergo chemical changes and this has an impact on our well - being as well. The irresponsible use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides have negatively affected plants and aquatic life. We continue to pollute the atmosphere with vehicle and industrial gas emissions.
                    <br><br>
                    In your lower grade levels, you were exposed to some chemical reactions, you’ve tested the reactivity of some metals and you’ve seen the color changes of an indicator when tested with acids and bases. You have also learned in chemical bonding, that atoms gain stability by losing or gaining electron/s.
                    <br><br>
                    In this lesson , you will further understand how a chemical change proceeds, how bonds are broken and new bonds are formed, and how chemical reactions are translated into chemical equations, where rearrangements of atoms causes the formation of new substance/s. A lot of these chemical changes made the quality of our lives better.
                    <br><br>
                    When a physical change occurs there is no breaking and forming of bonds. There are certain things that will help us identify if a chemical reaction has taken place. We call these evidences of chemical reactions.</p>

                    <p class="p4">Oxygen is vital to life. One interesting reaction which involves oxygen is the production of fire.
                        <br><br>
                        Fire has fascinated people for so long, that the ancient people even regarded it as one of the earliest elements. Fire was so important to them and they described it as an element that changes everything. The earliest theory about burning was the Phlogiston Theory. This theory by George Ernst Stahl in the 17th century stated that when a material burns, it releases a substance known as phlogiston, and this theory was accepted for a very long time.</p>
                        <p class="p3">Theory of Oxidation </p>
                        <p class="p4"><b>Antoine Lavoisier</b> through his careful observations from his experiments, debunked the phlogiston theory as he discovered that instead of releasing a substance (phlogiston) a material accurately burns as it reacts (uses) with oxygen. This is now known as the Theory of Oxidation, and this is accepted up to this day. For burning to occur, 3 factors should be present in proper conditions and proportions.</p>

                        <p class="p4">In our country, we are reminded 
                            that March is a Fire Prevention month, 
                            as this month signals the start of 
                            summer, the season when countless 
                            fires	 break	 out	 all	 over	 the	 country,	
                            “An ounce of prevention is better than 
                            a pound of cure” is a motto we all 
                            need to remember.

                            reactions	which	may	bring	benefit	or	harm	to	life	as	well	as	to	the	environment.
                            <br><br>A chemical equation is a chemist’s shorthand for a chemical reaction. 
                            The equation distinguishes between the reactants, which are the 
                            starting materials and the products which are the resulting substance/s. 
                            It shows the symbols or formulas of the reactants and products, the 
                            phases (solid, liquid, gas) of these substances, and the ratio of the 
                            substances as they react.
                            <br><br>Chemical	reactions	can	be	classified	according	to	the	following	types:
                            <br>A. COMBINATION REACTION: Reactants combine to form a single product.
                            The general formula for this reaction is:<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A		+		B		------→		AB
                            <br>B. DECOMPOSITION REACTION: In this reaction, a single reactant breaks down 
                            into simpler ones. ( 2 or more products). This is the reverse of combination reaction. 
                            The general formula for this reaction is:<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAB		------→		A		+				B
                            <br>C. SINGLE DISPLACEMENT (Replacement) REACTION. This is when one element 
                            replaces another element from a compound. The more active element takes the 
                            place of the less active element in a compound. The general formula for this reaction 
                            is:<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA		+		BC		------→		AC				+				B
                            <br>D. DOUBLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION (Metathesis). This is when the positive 
                            ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) of different compounds switch places, 
                            froming two entirely different compounds. The general formula for this reaction is:<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAB			+		CD			→			AD		+				CB		
                            <br>E. COMBUSTION (Burning) REACTION This when oxygen combines with a 
                            hydrocarbon to form water and carbon dioxide.
                            F. ACID-BASE REACTION: This is a special kind of double displacement that takes 
                            place when an acid and base react with each other.<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHCl		+		NaOH			----→			NaCl			+		H2O	</p>
